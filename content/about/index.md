<h3> Welcome to UDS@Leeds! </h3>
<p> Our Masters degree in Urban Data Science and Analytics offers you the opportunity to gain in depth knowledge of the methods and approaches of data science and learn how to apply them in understanding cities and setting urban policy.

The course will combine technical training in the latest data science techniques – from data wrangling, to machine learning, to visualisation, and beyond – with the critical thinking needed to interrogate and understand complex urban and mobility challenges.

At the heart of this course will be a commitment to tackling the real-world challenges facing cities.

Researchers at the University of Leeds are finding novel data-driven solutions to tackle challenges such as traffic congestion, social and economic equality, pollution and competition for resources. Find out more about our Urban Analytics research at Leeds. </p>

<h3> Course highlights </h3>

<ul> 
<li> Fieldtrips in an urban context will allow you to observe first-hand how data science can be used to create and shape urban policy, and how policies in turn impact urban systems and processes. </li>
<li>You will work closely with external organisations and stakeholders, through co-development of creative solutions to urban problems.</li>
<li>You will benefit from exposure to the wide range of urban research ongoing across the University - <a href = "https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography" > School of Geography </a>, Institute for Transport Studies, Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and the Alan Turing Institute, the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.</li>
<li>A new seminar series featuring urban researchers and practitioners will consolidate a wider network of urban data scientists and policymakers and provide you with direct routes to the latest research, trends, and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
  
On completion of this course, you will have the technical skills and knowledge to secure employment in a range of organisations in roles such as a data scientist, data analyst, or software developer.
